# BlackLite-Tools

BlackLite is a combination of "Black KoboldAI Lite", because this user-mod for KoboldAI Lite started as a tool to create a black theme for Lite, but grew more and more to a toolset that can do different theme centered actions and minor hacks to the Lite UI.

In the KoboldAI Lite Advenced Settings Tab click the Button:
![ApplytheUserMod](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/128c9491-c53e-495b-ab93-ea34287aae27)

Then add the source code of the BlackLite-Tools and click ok, to activate the Toolbox:
![PasteUserMod](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f0464d7-a095-48a4-b472-c7c166defe14)
